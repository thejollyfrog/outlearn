      <description>Are you feeling that there is something missing from you&amp;rsquo;re life? Do you enjoy activities that take you out of your comfort zone? If challenging yourself is something that would interest you, then why not try paddlesports?
In the UK, ‘paddlesports’ is the collective term for all paddling disciplines. In each of these watersports the paddler sits or stands on a board or vessel.
Beginners start paddling on flat water (lake or swimming pool) to develop basic skills, this helps them learn better control of their boat.</description>
