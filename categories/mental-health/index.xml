      <description>Are less children experiencing outdoor environments? This article talks about why children don&amp;rsquo;t play outside in today&amp;rsquo;s society and due to this could be labelled with having &amp;rsquo;nature deficit disorder&amp;rsquo; (NDD).
NDD was coined by Richard Louv (American author) in his book, &amp;lsquo;Last Child in the Woods&amp;rsquo; to highlight the problem he sees for young children today, and for their level of experience within natural environments, locally or not.
Louv recounts his experiences with the local environment (woods, parks, rivers fields and forests) when he was young, to which his son asked him, &amp;lsquo;why were things more fun when you were a child?</description>
