      <description>Your group are mermaids/mermens and they are trying to find the hidden trident. Only the trident will help them find the secret cave of Neptune. On your travels, you will see your friend Tallulah the turtle, who will help you in your quest to find the hidden trident.
The Walk Go for a walk around the area you wish to carry out the activities. Talk about mythical creatures and ask your group what they might think they would look like.</description>
