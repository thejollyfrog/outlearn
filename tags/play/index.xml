      <description>30 years ago, many children would stay outside all day, playing and exploring, only to return when it was time for their dinner.

      <description>Play is a natural behaviour, instinctively creating imaginative stories, games, and activities, which help develop social, emotional, intellectual, and physical skills. This creative language can help children integrate themselves with each other and understand the world around them.
In this article &amp;lsquo;get outside and play&amp;rsquo; is defined as a way to naturally learn and develop their soft skills by experiencing nature in its true form. This is important because not all children are accessing outdoor play and not all children learn best in the classroom.</description>
